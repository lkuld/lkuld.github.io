Welcome, I am a lecturer in the Department of Economics, KBS, University of Limerick. My research interests include urban economics, labour economics, and economic history. Most of my current projects fall into the economics of science and arts, where I am particularly interested in innovation processes and discrimination in the labour market. Beyond my core research, I have collaborated on discrimination and accountability in the labour market for the rural poor. I am always happy to chat about research ideas or anything related to studying in Limerick.
