Hi, I am a lecturer in the Department of Economics, KBS, University of Limerick. Currently, I serve as the course director for our MSc in Economics and Policy Analysis.
Please send me a mail, if you are interested or have any questions about the programme. 

You can reach me at lukas.kuld@ul.ie.

My research interests include urban economics, labour economics, and economic history. Most of my current projects fall into the economics of science and arts, where I am particularly interested in innovation processes and discrimination in the labour market. Beyond my core research, I have collaborated on discrimination and accountability in the labour market for the rural poor. I am always happy to chat about research ideas or anything related to studying in Limerick.
