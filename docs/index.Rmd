Welcome, I am an empirical researcher between urban economics, labour economics, and economic history. Most of my current research projects fall into the economics of science and arts, where I am particularly interested in innovation processes and discrimination in the labour market. Beyond my core research, I have collaborated on discrimination and accountability in the labour market for the rural poor and I am always interested in applying innovative data techniques, statistics and economic theory to new questions.
