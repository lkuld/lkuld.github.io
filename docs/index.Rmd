I am a Lecturer in the Department of Economics at the Kemmy Business School, University of Limerick, where I serve as Course Director for the MSc in Economics and Policy Analysis. I am happy to advise prospective applicants on the programmeâ€™s structure, entry routes, and study experience at UL.

My research sits at the intersection of urban economics, labour economics, and economic history. Much of my current work examines the economics of science and the arts, with particular attention to innovation processes, peer and place effects, and discrimination in labour markets. I have also collaborated on projects addressing discrimination and accountability affecting the rural poor.

I welcome enquiries about research ideas, supervision aligned with these areas, and studying in Limerick.
